# Malware Detection ðŸ‘€ Back End

This repository captures the back end API for receiving a portable executable file from the [front end application](https://github.com/gregmckenzie88/Malware-Detection-Front-End), generating a classification, and returning that payload to the front end.

Data analysis and modelling can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/gregmckenzie88/Springboard-Capstone-3-Email-Threat-Detection-System).

This project is forked from (https://github.com/fieldsfieldsfields/mallook)
